# Pixel Odyssey: Retro Realms

Pixel Odyssey: Retro Realms is a nostalgic NFT collection that pays homage to the golden era of gaming. Each piece in this collection is a unique pixel art creation, designed with a limited color palette and sharp pixelated lines, reminiscent of the classic 8-bit and 16-bit video games.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the NFT collection.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the HTML content.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file that fetches the NFT collection data from the server and populates the collection grid.
- `server.js`: The server-side JavaScript file that serves the NFT collection data through an API endpoint.
- `nftContract.sol`: The Solidity contract file for the NFT collection.
- `test.js`: The JavaScript file that contains tests for the server-side code.
- `package.json`: The package.json file for the project.
- `.env`: The environment variables file.
- `README.md`: The README file that you're currently reading.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file and define the `PORT` variable (e.g., `PORT=3000`).
4. Run `npm start` to start the server.

## Usage

To view the NFT collection, open `index.html` in your web browser.

To interact with the NFT contract, you'll need to deploy it to a blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum) using a tool like Truffle.

## Testing
